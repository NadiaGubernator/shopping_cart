# Online Store
This application is based on ['Agile Web Development with
Rails'](https://pragprog.com/book/rails51/agile-web-development-with-rails-5-1).

## Web store with catalog, cart, and orders.

It is divided into two main sections:

* The buyer's side of the application manages the catalog, cart, 
  and checkout.

* Only administrators can access stuff in the seller's side
  (product maintenance and order fulfillment).
